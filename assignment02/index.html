				<p>The scenery in the city of New york is very appealing. My hotel room looked out across the town. </p>
				<p>Simply walking aroud the town fun! I love the beautiful townscape and the atmosphere of the town. When I walk in there, I feel that New York is really an international city. There are table and chair all over the town. It is pleasure to sit down at one of them and listen to various languages. It have wonderful cafe and restaurants too. It's nice to have a comfortale cafe in the neighbarhood. </p>
				<p>If you'll go by yourself to New York, you can enjoy yourself as well. I was able to enjoy from the bottom of one's heart. </p>
				<p>You can do anything in New York, like you can hangout, work, and relax, anything!</p>
